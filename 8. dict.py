# in python, the dict is a series of key-value pairs
# a simple dictionary example
alien_0 = {"color": "green", "points": 5}
print(alien_0["color"])
print(alien_0["points"])

# now you can get the value associated with a key
new_points = alien_0["points"]
print(f"You just earned {new_points} points!")
